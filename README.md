# MachineLearningApplicationPythonJupyter
Created a machine learning program with Python coding and jupyter framework for data analysis/machine learning. The program will predict a new users music genre based on the new users input e.g. age, and gender.

There is 6 steps in this application:
  Step 1: Import sample data. 
  Step 2: Clean the data.
  Step 3: Create Model using a python algorithm (Decision-Tree).
  Step 4: Measure accuracy of the AI Model.
  Step 5: Train (persistance), and load Model for predictions.
  Step 6: Visualize Data Model via tree import.
